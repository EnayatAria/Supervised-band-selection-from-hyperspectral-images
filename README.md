# Supervised-band-selection-from-hyperspectral-images

This is an IDL code for selection an optimal spectral channels having maximum classs separability from a given hyperspectral dataset.  

The dataset used is the famouse Indian Pine hyperspectral dataset after removing noisy and bad spectal channels.

More details of the channel selection method is in: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-applied-remote-sensing/volume-11/issue-04/046010/Spectral-region-identification-versus-individual-channel-selection-in-supervised-dimensionality/10.1117/1.JRS.11.046010.full?SSO=1
